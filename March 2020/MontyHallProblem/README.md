# The Monty Hall problem
You are a contestant on a game show hosted by Monty Hall. On this game show, you are presented with three doors: two hiding goats
and one hiding a brand new car. You can make a choice but once you make your choice, Monty Hall opens one of the remaining doors
and reveals a goat. You are given another choice to either stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining door. Should
you switch or remain?
